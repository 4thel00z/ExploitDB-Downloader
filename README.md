# Requirements

You will need node and npm preinstalled on your system to be able to convert the csv to json via csvtojson npm package and to serve the json files as a light api replacement through the usage of json-server npm package.

# Installation

First of all install the global npm scripts via invoking ./installGlobals.sh. You might need to chmod +x the file beforehand if it is not executable.

Get the binary poc data via ./getData.sh. Make again sure the file is executable.
